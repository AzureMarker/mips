# MIPS assembler, simulator, and debugger
Or at least that's what I plan on doing :)

## Goals
- Assembler
  - [ ] Parse assembly code
  - [ ] Assemble code into object files
  - [ ] Link object files into final executable
- Simulator
  - [ ] Create a simulated MIPS CPU
  - [ ] Parse R instructions
  - [ ] Execute R instructions
  - [ ] Parse I instructions
  - [ ] Execute I instructions
  - [ ] Parse J instructions
  - [ ] Execute J instructions
- Debugger
  - [ ] Drive the simulator
  - [ ] Inspect the registers
  - [ ] Inspect the surrounding code/instructions
  - [ ] Breakpoints
